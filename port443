nano ~/.ssh/config
Run this in your terminal....

Add a New Configuration for GitHub:

Inside the file, add the following configuration:
bash
Copy code
Host github.com
    Hostname ssh.github.com
    Port 443
This configuration tells your system to connect to GitHubâ€™s SSH service on port 443 instead of the default port 22.
Save the File:

Press CTRL + X to exit, then Y to confirm saving, and Enter to confirm the filename.
Step 2: Test SSH Connection on Port 443
To verify that the changes were successful, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
ssh -T git@github.com
If the setup is correct, you should see a message like:

vbnet
Copy code
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
This means SSH is now using port 443 to connect to GitHub.
